Once upon a time there was a man who went to the store.
this man wanted to purchase some milk.
The store was out of milk.
The man lowered his head and walked out of the store.
One his way home he raised his eyes to the horizon laying his eyes on a beautiful sight.
Before him were thousands of cows on a farm.
The man really liked milk so he asked the farmer for a glass of milk.
Instead of a glass the farmer gave the man 3 gallons of milk.
With tears in his eyes the man accepted this generous offer.
3 new gallons in tow the man speed-walked home ready to drink all the milk he owned.
